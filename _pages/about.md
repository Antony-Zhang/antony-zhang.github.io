Hi! I am a final-year undergraduate student in Software Engineering at Wuhan University, and I'm currently applying for graduate programs in computational neuroscience to start my journey in the academy.

I'm fascinated by the complexity of human brain cognition (e.g. working memory, decision-making, learning, and emotion), and I look forward to working at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science to advance our understanding of biological and artificial intelligence.

<!-- I am working on my graduate project under the supervison of [Xiangbin Teng](https://www.psy.cuhk.edu.hk/index.php/component/sppagebuilder/?view=page&id=558) -->
